ACADEMIC USE DISCLAIMER:
This software is provided for academic research and educational purposes.
If you use this framework in your research, please cite our paper:

  Policy-Driven and AI-Augmented Cloud-Native Security."

SECURITY SCOPE NOTICE:
The 100% detection accuracy reported in this framework applies ONLY within 
the scope of the evaluated MITRE ATT&CK container techniques (T1496, T1068, 
T1611, etc.) as documented in the research paper. This does NOT imply 
universal detection capability across all possible or zero-day threats.
Use this framework as part of a defense-in-depth strategy.
