  abstract={Cloud-native applications operate in dynamic, distributed environments and face evolving security threats that traditional policy enforcement mechanisms cannot effectively mitigate. This paper presents a runtime-adaptive, multimodal security framework for Kubernetes-based cloud-native systems that seamlessly integrates policy enforcement, vulnerability assessment, runtime threat detection, and AI-driven anomaly detection within continuous deployment pipelines. The framework achieves 100\% detection accuracy (within evaluated MITRE ATT\&CK container techniques), 0\% false positive rate, and sub-50ms latency while maintaining minimal performance overhead (<10\% CPU, <15\% memory). Experimental validation on a production-grade K3s cluster over 101 days confirms the framework's scalability, reliability, and superiority over commercial solutions.}
